Purpose of the Application
The program we are building is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application that allows users to generate QR codes easily. QR codes are an innovative way of sharing information, whether it's a URL, text, or any data that a QR scanner can read. Our project demonstrates how Python's extensive libraries enable us to create such a user-friendly application.
The goal of the program is twofold:
1.	To create a functional tool for generating QR codes.
2.	To learn about Python's GUI capabilities and image-processing techniques.
By achieving these goals, we explore Python's versatility in merging creativity with practical implementation
